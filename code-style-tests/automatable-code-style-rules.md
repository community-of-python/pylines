- Follow PEP8
- Follow PEP257 when writing docstrings
- Follow PEP 526
- Follow PEP 484
- Enforce line length 120
- Import built-in libraries as whole modules (e.g., import os, import typing)
- Import any module with more than 2 imports as whole module (from x import A, B, C -> import x)
- Do not write explicit scalar type annotations when mypy can infer them (typing.Final still allowed)
- Narrow types as much as possible (prefer precise dict/TypedDict/Literal/Final types)
- Guard index/key access; use try/except with specific LookupError subclasses or use dict.get when appropriate
- Avoid except Exception; catch specific exceptions (use except Exception only when necessary)
- Keep try block to a single line when possible; only a few lines if unavoidable
- Prefer checks over exceptions for expected conditions (e.g., check key in dict instead of catching KeyError)
- Variable and function names must be at least 8 characters (no a/b)
- Use meaningful, specific variable names (avoid overly generic names like data, user)
- Function names must be verbs; nouns only allowed for @property
- Avoid comments; only write comments when necessary for complex implicit behavior
- Avoid get_ prefix for function names unless truly retrieving from memory; use more specific verbs
- Prefer immutability: annotate variables with typing.Final where it makes sense
- Mark classes with typing.final by default where it makes sense
- Wrap dicts with types.MappingProxyType by default where it makes sense
- Use dataclasses with kw_only=True, slots=True, frozen=True by default for logic/data classes
- Check regexes for ReDoS at https://devina.io/redos-checker
- Avoid magic/implicit behavior (hasattr/getattr are signs)
- Avoid temporary variables unless they add meaning or are reused
